* Version 0.9.1
 - Piknik can now be compiled for Plan9 and Solaris.
 - Sending an INFO signal to the server now prints whether the clipboard
is empty or not.
 - Godep was replaced with Glide.
 - Documentation fixes.

* Version 0.9
 - Support for protocol version 3 (Piknik <= 0.2) was removed from the server.
 Please upgrade the clients running these old versions.
 - Compatibility with protocol version 4 (Piknik >= 0.3 and <= 0.7) was
 restored.

* Version 0.8
 - The clipboard now includes a timestamp, so that clients can reject
content that is too old. By default, the maximum age is 7 days. This
can be adjusted with a "TTL" property in the configuration file. The
duration is expressed in seconds.

* Version 0.7
 - The number of simultaneous connections to a Piknik server can now
be controlled with the `-maxclients` command-line flag. When more than
90% of the available slots are filled, new sessions can only be open by
client IPs having recently completed a successful handshake.
 - New command-line flags: `-timeout` and `-datatimeout` in order to
enforce deadlines for handshakes and data transfers.

* Version 0.6
 - Improved error messages

* Version 0.5
 - A new switch, `-password` can now follow `-genkeys` in order to
deterministically derive the keys from a password. Not recommended,
but it can be useful to create an temporary initial configuration on air
gapped devices.
 - An Homebrew (tap) formula was added to easily install it and keep it up
to date on MacOS.

* Version 0.4
 - Servers recomputed the key ID instead of reading it from the
client, requiring the `EncryptSk` property to be present. This is no
longer the case. Thanks to jpmens@ for the bug report.

* Version 0.3
 - Improved documentation
 - The protocol was slightly changed; old clients are still supported
but the server must be updated in order to communicate with clients
running this version.
 - Precompiled binaries are now available for many architectures.

* Version 0.2
 - New `-move` operation to paste the clipboard content and delete it
afterwards. This introduces a protocol change, requiring an update to
the server and to the clients.

* Version 0.1
 - Initial public release.
